2013 was the year of origin of the most happening and engaging annual global open-source event - Hacktoberfest. 

It is a yearly occasion facilitated by DigitalOcean in partnership with GitHub, that intends to urge contributors to add to open-source ventures and reward the local area. 
Through this occasion, numerous open-source software enthusiasts, beginners, and the developer community gain the certainty to be essential to the open-source local area, and many open-source ventures and associations gain advantage by getting the assistance to develop their tasks.


The event was created to raise awareness for the open-source community and encourage participation in open-source projects. Participants are challenged to contribute a specific amount of pull requests during the month of October (so the name) to public open-source repositories on GitHub adding new experiences in their baskets along with the incentives of earning a limited-edition T-shirt and swags from the host and sponsors.
Hacktoberfest now in its 8th year has certainly contributed a lot to the open-source community and will still do seeing the multitude of people participating in it every year. 

Hacktoberfestâ€™21 is live from October 1st to 31st. Pull requests can be made for any GitHub or GitLab hosted repository/projects topic participating under the tag 'hacktoberfest'.
